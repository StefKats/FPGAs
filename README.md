# FPGAs
FPGAs in cloud computing and machine learning production pipelines

FPGAs can be used in a cluster to host a transformer

They can be connected with GPUs to host larger ML pipelines

Can facilitate high-speed data transfer for distributed training of large-scale machine learning models

Larger NN models can be compressed via quantization aware training, pruning and combining weights to be run with low latency and power consumption
